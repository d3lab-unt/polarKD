As one crucial component of the complex Earth\\nsystem [10, 11], changes in Arctic sea ice are found to have statistical and dynamical connec-\\ntions with regional as well as remote climatic impacts [12–15] (as shown in Fig. 1) through both\\nlarge-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations [16–20]. The rapid shrinking of the ice cover has\\nattracted much attention about the Arctic sea ice teleconnections and predictions from seasonal-\\nto-decadal time scales in recent years [21–24]. However, the understanding about its variability\\non weather time scales is still in its infancy [25, 26], although it is crucial for weather forecasting,\\nthe safety of commercial and subsistence maritime activities, the survival of polar mammals and\\nthe beneﬁt of polar economics. The impact of day-to-day Arctic sea ice variations has been un-\\nderestimated in most of the climate models [27]. To ﬁll this gap, here we adopt complexity-based\\napproaches and the climate network framework to investigate the daily WV of the Arctic sea ice\\nand its connections to climate phenomena on different spatio-temporal scales, including the Arctic\\nOscillation (AO), climate change and local weather conditions even in regions faraway.\\nComplexity science employs the mathematical representation of network science and provides\\na powerful tool to study the structure, dynamics and function of complex systems [28]. The climate\\nsystem is a typical complex adaptive system due to its nonlinear interactions and feedback loops\\nbetween and within different layers and components. In recent years, network science has been\\nimplemented to the climate system to construct the climate network (CN) [29]. The CN is a novel\\ntool to unveil and predict various important climate mechanisms and phenomena [30], including\\nforecasting of the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation [31, 32] and Indian summer monsoon rainfall [33,\\n34], the global pattern of extreme-rainfall [35], the changes of global-scale tropical atmospheric\\ncirculation under global warming [36], teleconnections among tipping elements in the Earth system\\n[37], the Indian Ocean Dipole [38] and so on.\\nThe AO is one of the major modes of atmospheric circulation over the mid-to-high latitudes of\\nthe Northern Hemisphere (NH) [39], which inﬂuences climate patterns in Eurasia, North Amer-\\nica, Eastern Canada, North Africa, and the Middle East, especially during boreal winter [40–42].\\n2'),\n",

Correspondingly, we ﬁnd that both the\\nsea ice and air temperature in mid-to-high latitudes of the NH changes more rapidly (i.e., with\\nblueshifted frequency spectrum) paired with more stable weather conditions (i.e., redshifted) in\\nregions further south during the AO positive phases, in contrast to the AO negative phases when\\npressure north of the Arctic Circle is higher than normal.

The standard devia-\\ntion (SD) is an effective technique to quantify the dispersion of data, but not a good measure for\\nirregularity, e.g., the SD of a randomly shufﬂed data is the same as the original. Besides, the auto-\\ncorrelation function describes how fast the self-similarity of a variable decays with time [57] and\\nthe power spectral analysis [58] allows us to discover periodicity in the data. Yet, a systematic\\nevaluation of the auto-correlation and the power spectrum as well as their dynamic evolution for\\nnon-stationary climate data are still lacking.\\nTherefore, here we introduce two mathematical functions: WACF and WPS (see Methods for\\ndetails) to quantify the WV in and around the Arctic in a given month, as well as its dynamic\\nbehavior during the period from Jan. 1980 to Dec. 2019. For a given time series, the physical\\nmeanings of these metrics are: higher values of the WACF stands for weaker short-term mem-\\nory; while higher values of the WPS indicates faster changes. In particular, to better understand\\ntheir physical meanings, we construct various nonlinear time series (as shown in Fig. 2a) via the\\nfollowing dynamical equations,\\nxt = cos (2πt/20), (1)\\nyt = cos (2πt/10), (2)\\nzx\\nt = 0.2xt + 0.8ut, (3)\\nzy\\nt = 0.2yt + 0.8ut, (4)\\nwhere t ∈[0,1000], ut is the nonlinear logistic function as: ut+1 = µut(1 −ut).

Our results are shown in Figs. 2d-h. A positive\\nvalue of r denoted by blue in Figs. 2d or e, indicates positive correlation between the annual\\nmean of WACF or WPS with the AO index. We observe that both WACF and WPS tend to be\\nhigher, i.e., indicating faster and more irregular day-to-day changes of ice cover, during the AO\\npositive phases than AO negative phases, in some parts of the Arctic region, such as, the Canadian\\nArchipelago, Beaufort Sea, and the Central Arctic. To illustrate the effect of the AO on WPS, we\\nshow that the power spectrum of Arctic sea ice during the AO positive phase, e.g., Jan. 1989,\\nis signiﬁcantly blueshifted comparing to that during the AO negative phase, e.g., Jan. 2010 (see\\nFig. 2f).

That is since both values of theWACF and WPS are signiﬁcantly increasing.\\nThe observed enhancing trend of WV may be attributed to the following two reasons: One is\\nrelated to the development of remote sensing and data analyzing technology, resulting in better data\\nresolution and accuracy over the data record; the other reason is the rapid decline of multi-year ice\\ncover, due to the dramatic increase of air temperature [61]. The multi-year sea ice has been deﬁned\\nas the ice that survives at least one summer melt and represents the thick sea ice cover, while the\\nﬁrst-year ice refers to the ice that has no more than one-year’s growth. As more of perennial ice\\ncover is replaced by younger and thinner ice cover, the regional ice cover becomes more fragile and\\nvulnerable to ﬂuctuations of air temperature or some other forces [44]. Therefore, local interactions\\nbetween the sea ice and atmosphere would be enhanced and the weather in the Arctic and remote\\nglobal regions may affect each other more easily through potential tele-connected pathways (e.g.,\\nFig. 5), which may increase the WV associated with the short-term weather predictability.\\nIn addition, we observe relatively more areas with a signiﬁcant trend of enhanced instability\\nin the melt season under global warming (see Fig. 4a). This is because during the melt season\\n(Apr.-Aug.), the sea ice declines and ﬂuctuates more dramatically than in other seasons when the\\nmonthly average ice cover extent (the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice, marked by the blue\\ncurve in Fig. 4a) reaches its maximum/minimum. An intensiﬁcation of the summer Arctic storm\\nactivity is also likely to happen as the land-sea thermal contrast increases under global warming\\n[62–64], which can increase the WV both in the ocean and atmosphere.\\n6'),\n",

In particular, the link weight quantiﬁes the similarity of temporal evolu-\\ntion between two different climate variables, i.e., the Arctic sea ice and the global air temperature.\\nBy comparing to a Null-model (see Methods), we observe the dynamic behavior of network con-\\nnectivity (as shown in Fig. S11a), which is deﬁned as the ratio of signiﬁcant links for each month’s\\nnetwork. The statistical signiﬁcance for each link is deﬁned by comparing to the null-model, see\\ndetails in Method section. A value of above 5% connectivity indicates statistically signiﬁcant syn-\\nchronization of weather between the Arctic and areas outside, such as Feb. 2010 (see Fig. S11b\\nand c), when the AO is in a strong negative phase and the cold polar air plunged into lower lat-\\nitudes of the NH and result in extreme weather conditions in a large area of the globe [67, 68].\\nWe identify the signiﬁcant Arctic-global teleconnection patterns by using climate network node\\ndegree ﬁelds, which are deﬁned as the number of signiﬁcant links that connect to the Arctic for\\neach global node, for two speciﬁc periods, Feb. 2010 (AO negative phase) and Mar. 2019 (AO\\npositive phase) in Fig. 5a and c, respectively.\\nMoreover, two typical links presented in Fig. 5 indicate strong synchronizations between the\\ndaily sea ice cover for one Arctic node and the air temperature for another remote global node\\n(their time series are shown in Figs.

This is\\nbecause during the positive phase of the AO, low pressure dominates the Arctic regions, leading\\nto a northward and intensiﬁed jet stream that blocks the outbreaks of frigid polar air into lower\\nlatitudes and reduces storm activity in California [69]. The uncovered teleconnection loop between\\nthe Arctic and California suggests that Arctic sea ice decline may drive more California droughts\\nand wildﬁres [70].\\nThe synchronization of day-to-day weather between the Arctic and other regions can favor\\npositive feedbacks of WV , where increasing WV/instability of the Arctic sea ice may cause a\\nhigher risk of extreme weather conditions in remote global regions.

By adapting WACF and WPS, we are able to identify signiﬁcant effects of the AO\\non day-to-day changes of the Arctic sea ice as well as the WV in mid-to-high latitudes of the\\nNH. We attribute the physical mechanism to the shifts of north-to-south location of jet stream\\nand storm-steering associated with different phases of the AO. Furthermore, we found that during\\nthe past 40 years, the Arctic sea ice variability on weather time scales is substantially increasing\\ndue to the melting of the thick perennial sea ice. Finally, in order to analyze the dynamic Arctic\\nweather connectivity, we have constructed multivariable climate networks, i.e., between the Arctic\\nsea ice and the global air temperature ﬁeld. By applying the shortest path method, we are able\\nto identify teleconnections paths as well as positive feedback loops of WV . We also proposed a\\npossible physical mechanism underlying these paths. The reduction of Arctic sea ice stability may\\nincrease the risk of unstable weather conditions and lead to reduced skill of weather forecasts [71]\\nglobally through the Arctic-global teleconnected feedback loops. Our new ﬁndings can help to\\nunderstand the physical mechanisms linking the AA and the global climate, and implies prominent\\nglobal impacts of the Arctic WV on human and natural systems under climate change [6, 49].\\nAs the Arctic is considered to be a barometer of global climatic change, in particular, Arctic sea\\nice loss is approaching a tipping point and is extremely crucial for the whole Earth’s climate [72].\\nBesides the immediate utility of being able to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of WV for local\\nArctic regions and its global impacts, our framework would be also applied to study and reveal\\nthe short-term synchronizations of connectivity among remote global regions, sea ice forecasting,\\nas well as systemic risk induced by the interdependency among other complex subsystems and\\ncascading of adverse consequences, which is particularly important for a systemic risk-informed\\nglobal governance.\\n9'),\n",
