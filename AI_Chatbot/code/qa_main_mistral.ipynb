Geotop-UQAM, Montreal, Canada \\n2. UC-Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium \\n \\nAbstract \\n \\nThe sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is an important element of the climate and ocean system in \\nthe Northern Hemisphere as it impacts albedo, atmospheric pressure regimes, CO2-exchange at the \\nocean/atmosphere interface as well as the North Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline \\ncirculation [1]. Due to global warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an \\nunprecedented rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the so-called \"Arctic \\namplification\" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also experienced large amplitude variations, \\nfrom seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch) time scales, in the past. Recent studies led to suggest that \\nwhereas insolation has been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level \\nchanges governed the development of \"sea-ice factories\" over shelves (Figure 1), thus fine-tuning \\nthe response of the Arctic Ocean to glacial/interglacial oscillations that is slightly out of phase  \\ncompared to lower latitudes [3,4]. We discuss below how insolation and sea-level changes may \\nhave interacted and controlled the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean during warm past intervals and \\nhow they could still interfere in the future.  \\n \\nThe \"Milankovitch\" pacing of the Arctic Ocean climate and sea-ice  \\n \\nThe insolation of the Summer solstice at 65°N is commonly used as a timer for ice growth and \\ndecay in the Northern Hemisphere [5]. However, because the Arctic sea-ice records its minimum \\nextent in September [6], the heat accumulated and transferred from lower latitudes over the whole \\nsummer season may be more relevant. Through time, the pacing of summer vs solstice precessional \\nmaxima are close (Figure 2a), but their relative amplitude differs significantly from one peak to \\nanother. Moreover, the two curves depict a timing offset of a few thousand of years (Figure 2b). \\nPrior to looking deeper into these features, the choice of the 65°N latitude (~ Iceland) for estimating \\na \"Summer\" insolation forcing of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover deserves examination. On one \\nhand, the pattern is not significantly different with Summer insolation at 80°N. It would be slightly \\nlower (-22.7±2.7 W.m-2; ± 1\\uf073) but nearly parallel. On the other hand, an important vector of heat \\ntowards the Arctic Ocean is the North Atlantic Water (NAW) mass (Figure 1), which flows \\nnorthwards from the Nordic seas through the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea, then circulates below \\nthe low-salinity surface layer of the Arctic Ocean. The 9 ± 2 Sv of NAW entering the Arctic Ocean \\nprovide a heat flux of about 40 TW [7], which plays a determinant role in the melting of Artic sea-\\nice in summer [8]. This heat flux is  practically set at the latitude of the northern North Atlantic \\nOcean, mostly in relation with the subpolar gyre [9] centered at about 60°N. The choice of 65°N \\nseems thus relevant and permits a direct comparison with the commonly used insolation curve \\nbased on the Summer solstice at this very latitude.  \\n \\nThe  2.5 ka time-offset observed between the Summer and June 21st insolation curves (Figure 2b), is \\na most interesting feature. It is probably not critical during insolation minima, due to the extensive \\nice sheets, but becomes critical between maxima such as that of the present Holocene interglacial. \\nAs recorded in marine sedimentary cores from the Central Arctic Ocean, the evidence for \\nsignificant sediment flux and productivity during the Holocene is dated at ca 8-9 ka [10], which is \\npractically in phase with the mean Summer season insolation peak but lags by ~ 2.5 ka the Summer \\nsolstice insolation peak (Fig. 2b). The dated foraminifera from this interval were mostly produced in \\nthe seasonally open sea-ice factories of the circum-Arctic shelves, then largely submerged as a \\nresult of the postglacial sea-level rise. These populations, almost exclusively composed of the \\nplanktonic Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, related to heterotrophic production in the subsurface-\\nmesopelagic layer [11]. They developed during the productive sea ice-free season, were carried \\nwith currents and/or uploaded into sea-ice with suspended sediment, then transported and deposited \\nalong the major sea-ice transit routes (TransPolar Drift and Beaufort gyre of Fig. 1), notably along \\nthe Lomonosov Ridge [4]. The high Summer insolation of the early Holocene combined with the \\nhigh nutriment availability linked to costal erosion due to the rising sea level (SL), triggered high \\nprimary productivity [12]. \\n \\nSummer insolation including the duration, height and succession of the maxima caused by climatic \\nprecession need to be taken into consideration (Fig. 2a). A comparison of  recent interglacials leads \\nto infer specific responses of the Arctic Ocean. For example, the long marine isotope stage (MIS) \\n11 has led to a significant retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet [13] and to sea-level rise about 20 m \\nabove that of the present interglacial. However, its Summer insolation was much below that of all \\nother interglacials of the last million years. Warm conditions in the Arctic Ocean during MIS 11 \\nwould thus be unlikely, which is consistent with paleoceanographic data from the northern North \\nAtlantic [14]. Model experiments forced with insolation led to similar inferences about MIS 11 \\n[15]. Unfortunately, the only attempt at the documenting of MIS 11 conditions in the Arctic Ocean \\n[16] from marine records cannot be used due to uncertainties in their chronostratigraphy. Based on \\nindependent chronostratigraphic evidence [10, 1], the interval assigned to MIS 11 in [16] can be re-\\nassigned to an older \"warm\" interval, probably MIS 15 according to the position of the \\nBrunhes/Matuyama magnetic reversal in the sedimentary sequence [16, 17].  \\nAnother feature of the Summer insolation deserves  attention. It concerns the relative amplitude of \\nthe precessional peaks of MIS 7 vs MIS 5. The insolation maxima of MIS 7a and 7e suggest \\nwarmer and more open Arctic Ocean than those of MIS 5a and 5e. This is supported by central \\nArctic marine records which document a longer duration and more effective sea ice rafting \\ndeposition during MIS 7 than MIS 5e [10,1]. Back in time, the MIS 15 evoked above presents much \\nanalogy with MIS 7.  \\nFrom an Arctic Ocean perspective, the Milankovich forcing of the whole Summer mean insolation \\nseems a robust driver although it is not fully carried in the literature, especially with respect to \\npaleoceanographic conditions during MIS 5e and 11, both weakly recorded in central Arctic Ocean \\nby seasonal sea-ice proxies.  \\n \\nThe sea-level control of the Arctic sea-ice dynamics \\nSea-ice mostly forms over the large Arctic Ocean shelves, especially in the Laptev and East \\nSiberian seas (Fig. 1a). During glacials, when sea-level was about 120-130 m below its present level \\n[18], Bering Strait, the shallow gateway (~ 50 m deep) linking the Arctic and  the Pacific oceans \\nwas emerged and closed, while the Barents Sea and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago gateways \\nwere practically closed by ice. The Arctic Ocean was then a deep semi-enclosed basin, with a \\nnarrow connection to the North Atlantic through the Fram Strait [19]. During glacial stages, the \\nArctic Ocean was covered by a thick ice shelf with ice streaming from surrounding glaciers (Fig. \\n1b) [20]. Following deglaciation, ice melting and the rising sea-level led to the re-opening of all \\ngateways, with a progressive submergence of Arctic shelves (Fig. 2a), thus fostering production of \\nsea-ice. \"Warm\" NAW then entered the Arctic Ocean through both the Fram Strait and the Barents \\nSea, with impact on the seasonal melting of sea-ice. On the Pacific facade, the opening of Bering \\nStrait permitted low-salinity waters from the North Pacific to enter the Arctic Ocean, impacting its \\nupper water mass stratification and sea-ice production over shelves. Today, the Pacific flux weights \\nup to 40% of the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean [21], aside bringing about 20 kmole.s-1 of \\nsilicium into the Western Arctic [22], hence also impacting diatom productivity, thus heterotrophic \\nplankton production. \\nAt the onset of the present interglacial, the Barents Sea gateway opened at ~12 ka BP [23]. The \\nBering Strait followed at ~ 11 ka BP [24]) when the global SL was about still ~ 50 m below the \\nmodern one [18]. However, maximum flow conditions through Bering Strait were only achieved in \\nmid-Holocene time [25], when the mean global sea-level reached its Holocene maximum [e.g., 24]. \\nData from the Chukchi Sea and the Western Arctic indicate that near-similar modern-like sea-level \\nand flow conditions through Bering Strait were only reached some 4 ka ago [25], i.e., at the onset of \\nthe Arctic cooling trend towards the neoglacial [4]. The \"downstream\" export of Arctic Ocean low-\\nsalinity water, in part originating from the Pacific, then impacts the AMOC [26]. As a consequence \\nof sea-level rise, not only the Arctic Ocean shows a specific interglacial timing and response, but its \\nfinal \"interglacial\" feedback on southern latitude, delayed by several thousand years, could perhaps \\nexplain apparently \"out-of-phase\\' instabilities .  \\n \\nSea-level seems thus a joker here, exerting a strong control over the Arctic Ocean hydrography and \\nsubsequently the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. The difficulty now is to document how \\nsea-level may have controlled, combined with the Summer mean insolation, the conditions of past \\n\"warm\" intervals in the Arctic Ocean. Usually, the stacked \\uf06418O of benthic foraminifers from deep-\\nsea cores is used as a proxy for sea-level changes through time [27]. However, taking into account \\nthe long delay, up to ~ 5 ka if not more, for a full transfer of the glacial meltwater isotope signal to \\nthe deep ocean [28], adding the smoothing effect of stacking and the complex 18O-salinity-ocean-ice \\nvolume relationships [29], we can assume that the Milankovitch-tuned benthic 18O stack cannot \\nprovide a time frame accurate enough to determine effective time-offsets for the achievement, in the \\nArctic Ocean, of \"full interglacial\" conditions that include minimum land ice volume, maximum \\nsea-level and full isostatic equilibrium. In addition, assuming that maximum rates of  sea-level \\nchanges would be reached within 2 kyr following the continental ice decay [30], sea-level rises \\nlinked to fast but short melting events are unlikely to be captured by the oceanic 18O-proxy of sea-\\nlevel.   \\n \\nThe Arctic Ocean during past interglacials \\n \\nWhatever the limitations of the marine \\uf06418O-stack as a proxy for sea level (SL) changes, it has to be \\nused for a reasonable assessment of the status of the Arctic sea-ice combined with the Summer \\ninsolation parameter for earlier interglacials. As illustrated Figure 2a,  we  define thresholds for the \\ntwo parameters, based on the summer mean insolation value at the onset of the present interglacial \\n(the Holocene), and the \\uf06418O-value corresponding to a SL ~ 50 meters below its present elevation, \\nwhen shelves were already largely-submerged and at the time Bering Strait opened. During MIS 5, \\nonly the optimum (MIS 5e) shows conditions suitable for  \"open Arctic Ocean\" (with probable \\nseasonal sea-ice melting), thus a short, ≤ 10 kyr interval, that is unlikely to have left more evidence \\nin sedimentary records than the present Holocene with about 1 or 2 cm-thick layers [3,4]. In \\ncontradiction, during the ~ 60 kyr long MIS 7, several intervals with open conditions were likely. \\nNoteworthy is the fact that the insolation peak of MIS 7e was significantly higher than that of MIS \\n5e, practically equivalent to that of MIS 7a. Accordingly, a much thicker MIS 7 layer can be \\nexpected in sedimentary records from the central Arctic Ocean. The strongest evidence for intense \\nsea-ice rafting during MIS 7 is provided by its high residual content in excess 230Th (230Thxs), the \\n230Th produced by the dissolved uranium in the ocean water [31]. Its scavenging in the water \\ncolumn indicates active sea-ice and brine production, thus seasonally open conditions [3],.  \\n \\nAnother striking feature is the unlikeness of any strong sedimentary recording of MIS 11, as its \\nmean Summer-season insolation remained very low in comparison with those of MIS 7 and MIS \\n15, notably (Figure 2a). MIS 11 distinctive features have been discussed in many papers, either \\nbased on data [14] or modelling [13]. From an Arctic Ocean perspective, the closest \"warm \\nanalogue\" of the Holocene would be MIS 9e rather than MIS 11. \\n \\nOn the contrary, evidence for a short \"open sea-ice\" interval during MIS 3 is provided by high \\n230Thxsvalues in sedimentary cores [3]. The event was likely too short to be recorded by the marine \\n\\uf06418O-stack. However, several studies indicate that mean SL could have been close to 40 below its \\npresent elevation some 55 ka BP [32], whereas the mean Summer-season insolation at that time \\nculminated well above that of MIS 11. This observation suggests that a high mean Summer-season \\ninsolation constitutes a necessary condition for an open Arctic Ocean since MIS 11 does not seem \\nwell recorded despite high SL and duration [27]. Two arguments support the existence a short open \\nArctic interval by ~ 55 ka BP. The first one deals with model experiments suggesting a deep (≥ \\n2000 m) and high (~ 20 Sv) convection at ~ 60°N in the North Atlantic [33], thus conditions not \\nunsimilar present ones. The second argument is provided by an isotopic and palynological study of \\ninterbedded ice wedges and peat layers near the Laptev Sea coast, which suggests milder conditions \\nduring MIS 3 than during MIS 5 [34].  Hence, a short MIS 3 \"warm\" Arctic Ocean event seems \\nplausible. Older intervals with similar insolation and high sea-level values deserve some attention  \\n(e.g., MIS 9a and 13a; Figure 2a).    \\n \\nThe Arctic Ocean: from triggers to feedbacks, from past to future \\n \\nFeedbacks of the specific climatic response of the Arctic Ocean towards climate/ocean conditions at \\nlower latitudes of the North Atlantic are several but the most important are i) the effect of sea-ice on \\nalbedo and latitudinal pressure gradients and ii) the impact of freshwater export on the AMOC. In \\nthe Arctic Ocean, slightly out of phase and shorter \"warm\" intervals with an early productivity \\npeak, then a later nearly stabilized freshwater budget, may have impacted \"interglacial\" conditions \\nat lower latitudes. Presently, the amplified warming of the Arctic under the present greenhouse-\\nforcing is irreversible  [35]. A close (pseudo) analogue of its near future could be found in the late \\nPliocene, when the atmospheric pCO2 was about 400 ppmV [36] and the boreal forest reached \\nEllesmere Island (Fig. 1b) on the Canadian margin of the Arctic Ocean [37]. Then, mean annual \\ntemperature on Ellesmere Island were probably close to those observed today in the Hudson Bay, \\nabout 2500 km southward. If we push the analogy further, the ~ 200 days.year-1 of sea-ice presence \\nin the modern Hudson Bay could well represent the fate of the Arctic ocean in the near future: a \\nseasonal-only sea-ice cover with higher productivity [38]. On a longer term, the ongoing melting of \\nthe Greenland and Western Antarctica ice sheet will lead to a sea-level rise of several meters, \\ndeepening the Bering Strait, thus lowering further the salinity budget of the Arctic Ocean, aside a \\npredicted runoff of circum-Arctic river [39]. Lower North Atlantic-Arctic pressure gradients, a \\nsluggish AMOC are the most immediate expected responses. Given the rapid ongoing changes in \\nthe cryosphere, it is thus also highly relevant to take into consideration the impact of sea-level rise \\non the Arctic freshwater budget, sea-ice dynamics and feedbacks in the ocean-climate system, for \\nclimate modeling [40] and a proper assessment of the Earth\\'s future climate.  \\n \\nReferences \\n1.

One of the defining features of both recent and historical cases of global climate \\nchange is Arctic Amplification (AA). This is the more rapid change in the surface air \\ntemperature (SAT) in the Arctic compared to some wider reference region, such as the Northern \\nHemisphere (NH) mean. Many different metrics have been developed to quantify the degree of \\nAA based on SAT anomalies, trends and variability. The use of different metrics, as well as the \\nchoice of dataset to use can affect conclusions about the magnitude and temporal variability of \\nAA. Here we review the established metrics of AA to see how well they agree upon the temporal \\nsignature of AA, such as the multi-decadal variability, and assess the consistency in these \\nmetrics across different commonly-used datasets which cover both the early and late 20th \\ncentury warming in the Arctic. We find the NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis most closely \\nmatches the observations when using metrics based upon SAT trends (A2), variability (A3) and \\nregression (A4) of the SAT anomalies, and the ERA 20th Century Reanalysis is closest to the \\nobservations in the SAT anomalies (A1) and variability of SAT anomalies (A3). However, there \\nare large seasonal differences in the consistency between datasets. Moreover, the largest \\ndifferences between the century-long reanalysis products and observations are during the early \\nwarming period, likely due to the sparseness of the observations in the Arctic at that time. In \\nthe modern warming period, the high density of observations strongly constrains all the \\nreanalysis products, whether they include satellite observations or only surface observations. \\nThus, all the reanalysis and observation products produce very similar magnitudes and temporal \\nvariability in the degree of AA during the recent warming period. \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nMetrics of Arctic Amplification (AA) allow us to distinguish the periods in which there is the \\ngreatest difference between the surface air temperature (SAT) response to climate change in the \\nArctic and in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) as a whole. There have been two periods in the \\n20th century which have been identified as exhibiting AA: in the 1920s to 1940s (Yamanouchi, \\n2010; Wood and Overland, 2010), and at the end of the 20th century continuing into the 21st \\ncentury (Overland et al., 2008; Serreze and Barry, 2011, Overland et al. 2016a). There are also \\nnumerous examples of AA in paleoclimate records and simulations (Masson-Delmotte et al., \\n2006; Miller et al., 2010; Brigham-Grette et al., 2013). In addition to this multi-decadal and \\nlonger-period variability in the observed AA, we can also see strong seasonal differences in the \\nmagnitude of AA (Serreze et al., 2009; Serreze and Barry, 2011). AA is generally strongest in \\nwinter (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Serreze and Barry, 2011), as seen for example by much \\nstronger Greenland warming in winter since the early 1990s (Hanna et al. 2012), when the SAT \\nis more sensitive to changes in thermal forcing (Davy and Esau, 2016). Such changes in thermal \\nforcing have been ascribed to feedback effects due to a reduction in sea-ice, the Planck feedback, \\nchanges in atmospheric water vapour, cloud cover, or increased advection (Serreze and Francis, \\n2006; Serreze and Barry, 2011; Screen et al., 2012). However, a recent analysis of global \\nclimate models has shown that much of the AA in the surface air temperature is due to local \\ntemperature feedbacks (Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014) whereby the persistent stable stratification \\nin the atmospheric boundary layer traps excess heat in a shallow layer of air, leading to \\nenhanced warming compared to the global average (Lesins et al., 2012; Esau et al., 2012). \\n \\nThere are several metrics which can be used to describe the difference in temperature response \\nthat is the signature of AA. It is necessary to have different metrics given that these metrics are \\noften used to select periods of interest to study different climate processes. For example, those \\nstudies which concentrate on positive climate feedbacks involved in AA will want to focus on \\nperiods of rapid Arctic warming, and so may use a metric for AA based upon the rate of \\nwarming in the Arctic. Meanwhile those studies looking at the effect on the general circulation \\nof a warmer Arctic may choose to use a metric based on the surface air temperature difference \\nbetween the Arctic and the NH.  \\n \\nArguably the simplest metric, and the most commonly used, is defined as the difference in the \\nSAT anomalies in two regions. SAT anomalies are calculated by removing the climatology \\nfrom the temperature time series at each location around the world and then a metric for AA is \\ncreated by taking an Arctic-average temperature anomaly and comparing it to some reference \\ntemperature anomaly (e.g. the NH mean). This comparison may be taken to be the difference \\nor the ratio of the two anomalies (Crook et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Francis and Vavrus, \\n2015). However, there is a danger when using a ratio of two variables as a metric of AA when \\nthe denominator can approach zero, as can sometimes happen where anomalies are used (Hind \\net al., 2016). Metrics based on temperature anomalies are subject to a high degree of temporal \\nvariability at monthly timescales and longer due to the relatively large natural variability of the \\nSAT in the Arctic (Legate and Willmot, 1990; Jones and Moberg, 2003). \\n \\nAn alternative metric for AA that was recently proposed uses the ratio of the absolute values of \\n30-year linear trends in the SAT over the Arctic and the NH (Johannessen et al., 2016). This \\nmetric has the advantage that, owing to the thirty-year running-window used to calculate the \\ntrends, it does not have the high temporal variability that is found in the metrics based on \\ntemperature anomalies, so it can readily be used to assess the behaviour of the Arctic on multi-\\ndecadal and longer timescales. This is an appealing metric for application to many climate \\nstudies which wish to focus on the climate-processes during extended periods of rapid Arctic \\nwarming; however, there are a couple of challenges with using this metric. Firstly, linear trends \\ncan be sensitive to outlier data points, especially when these are close to the beginning or end \\nof the record, and so such outliers can potentially introduce a high degree of variability to the \\nmetric (Liebmann et al., 2010). Secondly, in taking the ratio of two trends we must account for \\nthe uncertainty in both of the linear regressions when determining the value of the AA metric. \\nThis can lead to large uncertainties in the magnitude of the metric in addition to missing values \\nat times when we do not establish a statistically-significant difference between the two trends, \\nwhich can make it harder to assess temporal variability.  \\n \\nOne way around this issue is to use the inter-annual variability of the SAT to define the degree \\nof AA. Note that here we use the term variability to refer to the standard deviation of anomalies \\nregardless of their temporal structure (Suteanu, 2015). There is a larger inter-annual variability \\nin the SAT in the Arctic than in the globe as a whole (Legate and Willmot, 1990; Jones and \\nMoberg, 2003). This is partly due to synoptic activity and radiative-feedbacks in the Arctic \\n(Stone, 1997; Vihma 2014), the effects of which are amplified by the persistent stable \\nstratification found in the high latitudes, leading to a higher sensitivity of the SAT (Esau et al., \\n2012; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014). So the difference or ratio of the SAT variability in the Arctic \\nand some reference region can also be used as a metric of AA (Kobashi et al., 2013). This has \\nthe advantage that it is a temporally-continuous metric which allows us to fully assess seasonal, \\ninter-annual and multi-decadal temporal variability of AA. One can also use either differences \\nor ratios to describe the AA because the reference variability will not approach zero and so \\nmake the ratio unconstrained. \\n \\nThe last metric that we assess here is the coefficient of linear regression of Arctic SAT \\nanomalies against NH SAT anomalies (Bekryaev et al., 2010). This metric has the distinct \\nadvantage of being more stable over the choice of period as compared to other metrics of AA. \\nThis is because it reduces the influence of variability, and especially multi-decadal variability, \\non the signal of AA. Therefore it is a relatively robust metric for AA across a range of timescales.  \\n \\nIn this paper we do not seek to address the causes of AA, but instead we review a set of \\nestablished metrics for AA and assess how consistent they are across a range of existing datasets \\nand time periods. We also assess the sensitivity of the different metrics to choices of the period \\nof analysis and the choice of dataset. In Section 2 we present our methodologies and datasets; \\nin Section 3 we present the results from the different metrics; and in Section 4 we discuss some \\nimportant considerations when choosing a metric to assess AA. \\n \\n2. Methods \\nHere we present the results from four different datasets: two observational records and six \\nreanalysis. The two observational gridded temperature datasets are the NASA Goddard Institute \\nfor Space Studies’ “GISTEMP” (Schmidt et al., 2016) and the globally-extended version of the \\nMet Office Hadley centre’s HadCRUT4 temperature dataset by Cowtan and Way (2014), \\nHad4krig_v2. The six reanalysis datasets we used were the European Centre for Medium-Range \\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) 20th Century atmosphere-only reanalysis, ERA20C (Poli et al., \\n2016); the ECMWF’s interim reanalysis, ERAint (Dee et al., 2011); the Japanese \\nMeteorological Agency’s JRA55 (Kobayashi, et al., 2015); NASA’s Global Modeling and \\nAssimilation Office’s MERRA2 (Gelaro et al., 2017); the National Centre for Atmospheric \\nResearch’s CFSR (Saha et al., 2014); and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \\nAdministration’s 20th Century reanalysis version 2C, 20CRv2c (Compo et al., 2011). The \\nobservational datasets have a monthly resolution, while the reanalysis datasets are available at \\ndaily resolution. The reanalysis products greatly vary in which observations are assimilated. \\nThe ERAint, MERRA2, JRA55, and CFSR analysis include satellite observations in the \\nanalyses, whereas the 20CRv2c assimilated surface pressure, monthly sea surface temperature \\nand sea ice observations and the ERA20C used surface pressure and marine wind observations. \\nThe inter-comparison of these two century-long reanalyses with the shorter-period reanalysis \\nallows us to compare the effect of including more than surface observations on the \\nrepresentation of AA. Although it should be emphasized that surface observations of pressure \\nand marine winds in the Arctic are sparse for the early warming period with no coverage over \\nthe ocean, so we might reasonably expect the models to deviate in the representation of Arctic \\nclimate prior to the 1950s. When observational data are sparse the climate in the reanalysis \\nproduct becomes strongly dependent on the underlying dynamical model and consequentially \\nwill adopt any biases innate to the dynamical model. This severely limits are interpretation of \\nthe early warming period as there were very few observations from the Arctic Ocean at this \\ntime (Polyakov et al., 2003; Delworth and Knutson, 2000). \\n \\nFor each of these datasets we calculate four metrics of AA, henceforth labelled A1, A2, A3 and \\nA4 and these are summarised in Table 1. The first metric is the difference in SAT anomalies in \\nthe Arctic and the NH as a whole (A1); the second is the ratio of the magnitude of the 21-year \\nlinear temperature trend in the Arctic to that in the NH (A2); the third is the ratio in the inter-\\nannual SAT variability between the Arctic and the NH as a whole (A3); and the fourth is the \\nslope of the linear regression between the Arctic and NH SAT anomalies (A4).  \\n \\nSAT anomalies were calculated by subtracting the common reference period 1981-2010 \\nclimatological monthly means from the full time series for the respective calendar months. \\nAnnual anomalies were calculated by taking the mean of the monthly anomalies. Seasonal \\nanomalies were calculated by taking the means of three monthly anomalies using standard \\ndefinitions of winter (December, January and February) and summer (June, July and August). \\nThe Arctic and NH SAT anomalies were then calculated by applying area-weighted averages \\nover the respective regions. These two time series, Arctic and NH SAT anomalies, were then \\nused to calculate the different AA metrics. The 21-year linear trends were calculated by fitting \\na linear regression in time to the SAT anomalies and the regressions were tested for significance \\nusing a two-tailed student-t distribution. The interannual variability was calculated from the \\nstandard deviation of the SAT anomalies. The coefficient of linear regression between the two \\nSAT anomaly time-series in A4 was calculated using a least-squares linear regression on the \\nmonthly anomalies in a 21-year window and for each regression result statistical significance \\nwas tested as above. \\n \\nMetric ID \\nDefinition \\nReference \\nA1 \\n{SAT anomaly in Arctic} – {SAT anomaly in \\nNH} \\nFrancis and Vavrus, 2015 \\nA2 \\n|SAT 21-year linear trend in Arctic| /  \\n|SAT 21-year linear trend in NH| \\nJohannessen et al., 2016 \\nA3 \\n{Inter-annual SAT variability in Arctic} /  \\n{ Inter-annual SAT variability in NH} \\nKobashi et al., 2013 \\nA4 \\nCoefficient of linear regression between Arctic \\nand NH SAT anomalies \\nBekryaev et al., 2010 \\n \\nTable 1. Summary of metrics for AA used in this manuscript. \\n \\nIn all cases a common mask was applied to the different datasets to avoid any issues of \\ndifferences in spatial or temporal coverage. Since the GISTEMP has the least coverage of the \\ndatasets used here, all the other datasets were regridded to the GISTEMP resolution (2o by 2o) \\nusing a spline-interpolation and a common space-and-time mask was applied. In all cases the \\nArctic is defined as the region north of 70\\u200aoN and the NH as the region between 0\\u200aoN and 90\\u200aoN. \\nWe also computed the metrics using two alternative definitions of the Arctic as being the region \\nnorth of 60oN and north of 80oN, but found no significant change in the results in either test \\n(Figure S1, S2, S3, S4). This may be expected given that there is a very high correlation between \\nthe Arctic SAT anomalies defined as north of 60\\u200aoN and north of 70\\u200aoN e.g. r\\u200a=\\u200a0.92, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01 \\nbetween these two definitions in the Had4krig_v2 dataset.  \\n \\n3. Results \\nFigure 1 shows the AA as defined by the difference in temperature anomalies between the \\nArctic and the NH (A1) smoothed using a 21-year running-mean to highlight the long-term \\nvariability. In the annual-mean there is a strong, multi-decadal variability seen in the two \\nobservational datasets and the ERA20C reanalysis with a peak in AA around 1940, a minimum \\naround 1970, and a strong increase in AA in the periods from 1910 to 1940 and from the 1980s \\nto the present. All the metrics except A2 agree that the current annual-average AA is the \\nstrongest it has been since records began. This is most apparent when we take a shorter window \\nover which to assess the metrics, which is a consequence of the very fast pace of change in the \\nArctic in the last 20 years (Figure 2). However, this is not the case when we look at the seasonal \\nvariation in the strength of AA. In the two observational datasets the early warm period, in the \\nmid-1930s, had as strong or stronger winter-time AA. The winter generally has much stronger \\nAA than the summer, and we also see much greater variability in the strength of AA in the \\nwinter (Figure 1C, 1E). This is largely due to the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of melting \\nice on the Arctic summer climate. Although in the two century-long reanalysis products, both \\nreach maxima in the early 21st century. In the summer it is only the 20CRv2c which has a strong \\n(and negative) AA at any time. In all the other datasets the magnitude of summer AA is always \\nclose to zero. \\n \\nOn the annual average we can see there is very good agreement between the observational \\nrecords with only a small negative bias in the GISTEMP temperature with respect to the \\nHad4krig record. This bias is strongest during the early-warming period when observations \\nwere sparse. The ERA20C reanalysis closely matches the observations from the 1940s through \\nto the present day, but has a clear bias in the early 20th century. In contrast, the 20CRv2c \\nreanalysis has very little correspondence with the observed temperature differences throughout \\nthe 20th century. These relationships between the datasets can be seen in the corresponding \\nTaylor plot (Figure 1B). Note that since the modern-era reanalyses (ERAInt, MERRA2, CFSR, \\nand JRA55) cover only a short period after applying the 21-year smoothing, they were not \\nincluded in the Taylor-plot analysis. While both the reanalysis show similar variability to the \\nobservational datasets, only the ERA20C has a good correlation with the observations (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.64, \\np\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). \\n  \\nThe large differences between the reanalysis products in the early warming period are likely \\ndue to the sparseness of the observations in the Arctic at this time. This can be seen from the \\ndifference in consistency between the representation of the early warming and recent warming \\nperiods in the different reanalysis products. The same variables are assimilated throughout the \\nfull period of the two century-long reanalyses, but the number and representativeness of the \\nobservations varies considerably in that time. In the modern warming period the high density \\nof observations strongly-constrains all the different reanalysis products whether they include \\nsatellite observations or only surface observations. As a result all the reanalysis and observation \\nproducts produce similar magnitudes and temporal variability in the degree of AA during the \\nrecent warming period. \\n \\nThe 20CRv2c reanalysis gives a very different result to the other datasets in winter with only a \\nnon-significant correlation to the GISSTEMP record, principally due to the presence of a period \\nof strong increase in AA from the 1950s to the late 1970s which was not found in the \\nGISSTEMP, or any other, dataset. The ERA20C shows a similarly close correspondence to the \\nobservational datasets in winter as in the annual average with a similar pattern of multi-decadal \\nvariability, although there is a generally weaker AA than was found in the observational \\ndatasets. However, in the summer there is very little correspondence between any two datasets; \\neven the two observational datasets have a non-significant correlation. The 20CRv2c reanalysis \\nmay be expected to deviate from observations as the underlying model has known problems \\nwith reproducing the SAT in the Arctic due to a misspecification of sea ice in coastal regions \\n(Compo et al., 2011).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1. (A) The AA defined by the annual-average temperature difference between the Arctic \\ntemperature anomaly and the NH temperature anomaly smoothed using a 21-year running-mean \\n(A1). This is shown for the six reanalysis products: ERA20C; 20CRv2c; ERAint; MERRA2; \\nCFSR; and JRA55, and the two observational datasets: GISTEMP and Had4krig_v2. (B) A \\nTaylor plot of A1 for the annual mean which shows the standard deviation of each of the time-\\nseries of the full-period datasets, and the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-square \\nof the errors (RMSE) between each series and the reference dataset, GISTEMP. The same \\nanalysis is repeated for the winter (C) and (D), and the summer (E) and (F). \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. The four metrics for AA from the GISTEMP data calculated using three different \\nlengths of running-window: 11, 21, and 31 years.  \\n \\nThe ratio of the 21-year trends in the Arctic and NH, A2, is shown in Figure 3. Due to the \\nconstraint that we require statistically significant trends in both the Arctic and NH in order to \\nbe able to obtain a value for this metric, there are large gaps in the time-series for all the datasets. \\nWe also removed all values greater than 10, as per Johannessen et al., (2016). There are two \\nperiods where there are relatively long records of AA that are statistically significant: from \\naround 1915 to 1940 and from the mid-1980s to the present. In the most recent period we can \\nsee a general increase in the degree of AA from the mid-1980s to the present indicating an \\nincreasing rate of warming in the Arctic as compared to the hemispheric-average. While all the \\ndatasets indicate a strong AA in the mid-1950s, it is only the ERA20C dataset for which the \\nvalues for the metric are statistically significant. At no point was there a statistically-significant \\nvalue of A2 less than or equal to one: so Arctic temperature trends were always found to be \\ngreater than the hemispheric average. During the 1990s the Arctic warming was approximately \\ntwice as strong as the hemispheric average and that has been increasing in recent years \\naccording to all reanalyses data (Figure 3A, 3C). The most recent values of A2 indicate that the \\ncurrent rate of warming in the Arctic is around three times greater than the hemispheric average \\nand still increasing, although notably similar A2 AA rates were found in the 1920s. \\nAs with A1, the seasonal analysis shows us that it is in the winter when we have the strongest \\nAA (Figure 3C). In three of the datasets, the two observational datasets and the 20CRv2c, the \\ncurrent AA shows the Arctic winters warming at over 6 times the rate of the hemispheric-\\naverage. In these three datasets the most recent values of A2 are the highest that were seen in \\nthe full period.  \\n \\nIn the annual-average the two observational datasets have the best agreement, with a high \\ncorrelation and similar variability (Figure 3B). However, in contrast to the results from the A1 \\nmetric, both ERA20C and 20CRv2C reanalysis have close correspondence to the observational \\ndatasets with a high correlation with the GISTEMP record (both with r\\u200a=\\u200a0.80, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.05), and a \\nsimilar temporal variability. In the seasonal analysis there are much larger differences between \\nall the datasets. In the winter (Figure 3D) it is the 20CRv2c which has the highest correlation \\nto the GISSTEMP record (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.78, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.05), although the greater temporal variability means \\nthat it has a similar RMSE with respect to the GISSTEMP record as the other observational \\nrecord, Had4krig-v2. In contrast the ERA20C shows similar variability to the GISSTEMP \\nrecord, but a non-significant correlation. In the summer there is a generally weak AA with most \\nvalues of A2 lying between 0 and 2. While there is a good correlation between all the datasets \\n(Figure 3F) there is a large difference in the magnitude of the variability, leading to poor overall \\nconsistency between the 20CRv2C and the other datasets. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3. A) The measure of AA defined by the ratio of the absolute value in the 21-year linear \\ntrend in Arctic and NH SAT anomalies (A2). This is shown for the six reanalysis products: \\nERA20C; 20CRv2c; ERAint; MERRA2; CFSR; JRA55, and the two observational datasets: \\nGISTEMP and Had4krig_v2.

In the observational datasets there is \\na general increase in A3 from the start of the 20th century until around 1960, followed by a \\ndecrease until the early 1990s until there is a sudden switch to a rapid increase in AA from the \\nearly 1990s continuing to the present. This pattern is seen in the both of the reanalyses, although \\nthe timing of the decrease in AA is less clear in the 20CRv2c reanalysis. In the minima, Arctic \\ninter-annual variability is around twice as large as the hemispheric average and in periods of \\nstrong AA it may be three or four times larger. Compared to observational datasets, shorter-\\nperiod reanalyses (e.g. ERAint and JRA55) tend to show a more rapid increase in AA in the \\n1990s, both in the annual-average and the wintertime (Figure 4A, 4C). The strongest AA was \\nfound in the winter with A3 in the observational datasets peaking in the most recent years at \\nvalues around 5 (Figure 4C). The observational datasets and the ERA20C also show a similar \\nmulti-decadal pattern in the winter as we see in the annual-mean, although the increase in AA \\nin the early 1990s is much more rapid in winter. The highest summer-time AA in the \\nobservational datasets occurred in the 1960s (Figure 4E). The summertime AA shows a much \\nsmoother multi-decadal variability with the observational datasets having a smooth increase in \\nA3 from the start of the 20th century until the 1960s, a decline until the mid-1990s, followed by \\nan increase into the 21st century. The ERA20C reanalysis has a similar temporal structure to the \\ntwo observational datasets, but the 20CRv2c is very different with a general decrease in the \\nsummer AA throughout the whole period. \\n \\nIn the annual-average and wintertime the results are highly consistent between the two \\nobservational datasets, especially since the 1960s. This can be seen in the corresponding Taylor \\nplots where the correlation between the two observational datasets is very high (r\\u200a>\\u200a0.9, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01) \\nand there is only a small difference in the variability (Figure 4B, 4D). Some small differences \\nmay be expected due to differences in the stations and processing techniques used to generate \\nthe two datasets. In the annual average both of the reanalysis show similarly good correlation \\nwith the observational datasets (r\\u200a>\\u200a0.63, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01 and r=0.62, p<0.01 for the ERA20C and \\n20CRv2C respectively), although the ERA20C has a greater variability than either of the \\nobservational datasets. However, in the seasonal analysis we can see large differences between \\nthe two century-long reanalyses. In the winter, while the ERA20C shows a good correlation \\nwith the GISSTEMP record (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.72, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01), the 20CRv2c has a very poor correspondence \\n(r\\u200a=\\u200a0.30, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01) with no decrease in AA between the 1960s and 1990s. In the summer the \\n20CRv2c has an even worse correspondence to the observations with a non-significant \\ncorrelation to the GISSTEMP record, while the ERA20C has a relatively higher correlation to \\nthe GISSTEMP than the other observational record (r\\u200a>\\u200a0.44, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). So while the 20CRv2c \\nmay appear to be a good choice when assessing AA using A3 in the annual-average, it does a \\nvery poor job in reproducing the observed seasonal differences in A3.  \\n \\nFigure 4. The AA defined by the ratio of the inter-annual temperature variability in a 21-year \\nrunning-window between the Arctic and the NH (A3). This is shown for the six reanalysis \\nproducts: ERA20C; 20CRv2c; ERAint; MERRA2; CFSR; JRA55, and the two observational \\ndatasets: GISTEMP and Had4krig_v2. (B) A Taylor plot of A3 for the full-period datasets using \\nGISTEMP as the reference dataset. The same analysis is repeated for the winter (C) and (D), \\nand the summer (E) and (F). \\n \\nThe time-series of annual-averaged A4 from the four datasets considered here are shown in \\nFigure 5A. The two observational datasets show a high degree of similarity to the results from \\nA1 with a peak in the 1930s to 1940s, a minimum during the 1970s and increasing AA from \\naround 1980 to the present day. Similar to A3, ERAint tend to present more rapid increase in \\nAA during 1990s (as shown in Figure 5A, 5C). In the minima in the 1970s the value of A4 is \\naround 1, indicating that the magnitude of temperature anomalies is the same in the Arctic as \\nin the hemispheric-average. We also note that A4 shows the strongest magnitude of AA when \\nwe use the simultaneous SAT anomalies in the Arctic and in the NH i.e. there is no indication \\nthat either the Arctic or the NH is leading the AA (Figure S5). However, during periods of \\nstrong AA, Arctic anomalies are typically twice as strong as the hemispheric average with the \\nmost recent years having the strongest AA with Arctic anomalies currently around three times \\nlarger than the hemispheric average. There is a very good agreement between the observational \\ndatasets as to the temporal structure of A4 (r\\u200a= 0.93, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01) and they have similar variability \\n(Figure 5B). It is the 20CRv2c reanalysis which most closely matches the observations with \\nr\\u200a=\\u200a0.83, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01. While the ERA20C reanalysis has a very good match to the GISTEMP records \\non the temporal variability of A4, the timing of the variability does not closely match that of \\nGISTEMP (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.47, p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). Despite the similarity between the results for A1 and A4 in the \\nobservational datasets, it should be noted that while ERA20C had a similar match to the \\nobservations in these two metrics, the 20CRv2c has a considerably better fit to the observations \\nfor A4 than for A1.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. The AA defined by the ratio of the slope of the linear regression between Arctic and \\nNH surface air temperature anomalies in a 21-year running-window (A4). This is shown for the \\nsix reanalysis products: ERA20C; 20CRv2c; ERAint; MERRA2; CFSR; JRA55, and the two \\nobservational datasets: GISTEMP and Had4krig_v2. (B) A Taylor plot of A4 for the full-period \\ndatasets using GISTEMP as the reference dataset. The same analysis is repeated for the winter \\n(C) and (D), and the summer (E) and (F). \\n \\nOf the two century-long reanalysis datasets, NOAA’s 20CRv2c is closest to reproducing the \\nresults from the observations using the metrics based upon the SAT trends (A2), variability (A3) \\nand regression (A4) of the SAT anomalies. In contrast, the ERA20C reanalysis very closely \\nmatches the SAT anomalies (A1) and variability of the SAT anomalies (A3) for most of the 20th \\ncentury. So, for example, if one wishes to assess the atmospheric dynamics during periods of \\n20th century AA using A2 or A4 then the 20CRv2c may be a better choice of reanalysis than the \\nERA20C, but both 20CRv2c and ERA20C would be good when using A3. \\nAll the metrics indicate that the period from around 1990 to the present is one of increasing AA, \\nand this is also a consistent result across the different datasets. However, there are large \\ndifferences in the interpretation of AA prior to the satellite era (1979-present) depending upon \\nthe choice of metric and dataset. In the observational datasets there was a peak in the AA around \\n1940 in the A1 and A4 metrics, whereas in A2 and A3 this period of AA didn’t peak until the \\n1950s, although this cannot clearly be confirmed from A2.   \\n \\n4. Discussion and conclusion \\nThere are several aspects which should be considered when determining what metric to use to \\nmeasure the degree of AA. First, it should be a metric which is especially sensitive to the process \\nbeing studied while considering that, although the mean and standard deviation of surface air \\ntemperature are mathematically orthogonal, they are physically related (Esau et al., 2012). \\nSecond, one should avoid using ratios when the denominator is a metric which may approach \\nzero, such as for trends or anomalies. Hind et al. (2016) have previously highlighted this \\nproblem, but we emphasize it here because it arose in our consideration of the ratio of trends, \\nA2. Third, it should be a metric of a variable which is well-characterised in the dataset being \\nused. For example, the 20CRv2c reanalysis is reasonably consistent with the observations when \\nit comes to the variability but has a very poor consistency with observations in the Arctic \\ntemperature anomalies. Fourth, one needs to consider the timescale that is relevant to the \\nprocess being examined. The metrics related to the linear trends or inter-annual variability have \\nnon-independent values for each year due to the use of a running-window, and so they cannot \\nbe used to study temporal behaviour at periods shorter than the window length e.g. 21 years in \\nthe metrics presented here; whereas A4 may be used to generate an independent value for each \\nyear or season and A1 may be calculated at any temporal resolution. So if one wants to study \\nthe year-to-year variability in AA, then A1 or A4 may be the most appropriate choice of metric. \\n \\nIt is also important to consider the seasonal differences in the characterisation of AA in a given \\ndataset. For example, the inter-annual variability in the 20CRv2c has a good match to the \\nGISTEMP gridded-observations in the annual average, but this is due to a combination of a \\npositive bias in the winter and a negative bias in the summer (e.g. for A3 and A4). So in a \\nseasonal assessment of inter-annual variability it is the ERA20C which more closely matches \\nthe GISTEMP observations. However, in general there is less agreement between datasets as to \\nthe strength of AA in summer as AA is generally weaker in summer than in winter. The only \\nexception to this was in the ratio of SAT trends for which there was a good agreement between \\nall the datasets as to the temporal structure of the metric in summer, although there were large \\ndifferences in the variability. \\n \\nAnd finally, another important property of a metric of AA is that it equally compares climatic \\nvariations in the Arctic to those in the wider NH. For example, if we took the differences in the \\ninterannual variability in these two regions as our metric, this metric would be mainly \\ndetermined by the changes in the Arctic due to the much higher variability in this region. So, \\nalthough we have cautioned against the use of ratios when measuring AA, if the metric does \\nnot become sufficiently small to produce strong non-linearities, this can be an effective way to \\ngive equal weighting to the changes in the Arctic and the reference region. Another option \\nwould be to introduce an appropriate weighting, e.g. scaled to the magnitude of the variability \\nin each region, so that the contribution to the value of the metric from each region is equal; such \\nas is done for the standard normalised Azores minus Iceland NAO index.  \\n \\nAcknowledgments  \\nThe NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies’ “GISTEMP” data can be obtained from \\nhttp://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/.

Accurately\\nforecasting Arctic sea ice from sub-seasonal to seasonal scales\\nhas been a major research question with fundamental challenges\\nat play. In addition to physics-based Earth system models,\\nresearchers have been applying multiple statistical and machine\\nlearning models for sea ice forecasting. Looking at the potential\\nof data-driven approaches to study sea ice variations, we propose\\nMT-IceNet – a UNet-based spatial and multi-temporal (MT)\\ndeep learning model for forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration\\n(SIC). The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with\\nskip connections and processes multi-temporal input streams to\\nregenerate spatial maps at future timesteps. Using bi-monthly and\\nmonthly satellite retrieved sea ice data from NSIDC as well as\\natmospheric and oceanic variables from ERA5 reanalysis product\\nduring 1979-2021, we show that our proposed model provides\\npromising predictive performance for per-pixel SIC forecasting\\nwith up to 60% decrease in prediction error for a lead time of\\n6 months as compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.\\nIndex Terms—spatiotemporal data mining, neural networks,\\nUNet, sea ice forecasting, climate change\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nThe Arctic is a region with unique climate features. For\\ninstance, in the Arctic, the Sun never rises over the horizon\\nbecause of which the seasonal variations in polar day and\\nnight are extreme. The enormous areas of Arctic ice and\\nsnow are responsible for reflecting sunlight back to space\\nwhich keeps the planet cool and regulates global and regional\\nweather patterns. However, the Arctic sea ice has seen a\\ncontinuous decline since 1979 and is left half of which it\\nwas in 1970. Therefore understanding Arctic Amplification\\nand forecasting sea ice is a key research topic of climate\\nscience. It is important to predict fluctuations in the Arctic\\nsea ice by modeling the weather patterns as it can improve our\\nunderstanding of potential changes facing the global climate.\\nTo study climate change, environmentalists and domain\\nexperts rely greatly on dynamic forecasting systems [12] that\\nare mainly based on coupled Earth System Models. However,\\nover the last few years, researchers have shifted their focus\\nto data driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches like\\nmachine learning and deep learning. Since the climate data\\npresents high spatiotemporal correlations, machine learning\\nmodels have shown promising results in spatiotemporal data\\nmining leading to short and long-term weather forecasting.\\nMachine Learning (ML) can provide valuable tools to tackle\\nclimate change. For example, ML approaches can be used\\nto forecast El-Nino events, hurricanes, and ocean eddies and\\nunderstand the role of greenhouse gases and aerosols on\\nclimate trends and events.\\nRecent works on climate analytics include Convolutional\\nand Recurrent Neural Network [6] based models and some\\nhybrid modeling approaches like Convolutional LSTM [16],\\n[20] and GraphCNN [4]. However, due to the unique nature\\nof the problem of forecasting Arctic sea ice, there are several\\nlimitations to the existing solutions and multiple challenges.\\nEnlisted below are some of the prevailing challenges in\\nforecasting Arctic sea ice:\\n• Performance versus lead-time trade-off while predicting\\nper-pixel sea ice variations from sub-seasonal (two weeks\\nto three months) to seasonal (three months to two years)\\nscales.\\n• Inability to capture the annual minimum and maximum\\npeak values of sea-ice in the non-stationary time-series\\ndatasets.\\n• Small data problem owing to the availability of only few\\ndecades worth of observational data.\\nIn this paper, we propose a modeling framework, MT-\\nIceNet, to tackle the aforementioned challenges with promis-\\ning results. Our implementation code can be accessed at the\\nBig Data Analytics Lab GitHub repository1.\\nA. Problem Definition\\nIn all the research works conducted (details in Section II),\\nthere has not been a one size fits all solution proposed to tackle\\nthe problem of simultaneously detecting, monitoring and pre-\\ndicting sea ice variations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose\\nMT-IceNet – a fast converging UNet-based [19] spatial and\\nmulti-temporal (MT) regression model for forecasting Arctic\\nsea ice concentration (SIC) at sub-seasonal to seasonal scales.\\nMore formally, given:\\nInput\\n1github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/mt-icenet\\narXiv:2308.04511v1  [physics.ao-ph]  8 Aug 2023\\n– X1i, monthly observational and reanalysis data where\\ni = [1, 5] with a rolling window of 12 monthly records\\nequivalent to one year.\\n– X2i, bi-monthly observational and reanalysis data where\\ni = [1, 5] with a rolling window of 24 bi-monthly records\\nequivalent to one year.\\nMT-IceNet learns from past values of atmospheric and oceans\\nvariables (details in Table I), along with past SIC spatial maps\\nto forecast:\\nOutput\\n– Y , monthly per-pixel Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) values\\nat lead time of N months, where N = [1, 6].\\nHere, lead time represents future forecasts of SIC values\\nwith a lag of one to six months between the input predictors\\nX and outcome predictand Y.\\nB. Contributions\\nIn light of the aforementioned background information, the\\nmain goal of this research is to develop a spatiotemporal\\ndeep learning model that forecasts Arctic sea ice concentration\\n(SIC) at future months, given spatial data at multiple sub-\\nseasonal scales i.e. bi-monthly (15 days) and monthly levels.\\nOur major contributions are:\\n• We combine reanalysis and observational meteorolog-\\nical data from multiple sources into two self-curated\\nspatiotemporal datasets of uniform geographic grid and\\nmulti-temporal resolutions.\\n• We propose MT-IceNet - a spatial and multi-temporal\\ndeep learning model that incorporates a multi-stream\\nlearning approach for multi-temporal data and forecast\\nsea-ice on a monthly seasonal scale of up to 6 months.\\n• We perform a thorough comparative analysis between\\nMT-IceNet, baseline models and recently proposed SIC\\nprediction models for forecasting Arctic Sea ice at sea-\\nsonal scale.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Some of\\nthe important related work is reported in Section II. Section\\nIII describes the details of our dataset. Our proposed model\\nis presented in Section IV. Section V provides results and\\nanalysis of our experimental study and comparative analysis.\\nFinally, we conclude our paper and share future directions in\\nSection VI.\\nII. RELATED WORK\\nMajority of the recent works on climate analytics either\\ninclude Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network based\\nmodels or some hybrid modeling approaches like Convolu-\\ntional LSTM [20] and GraphCNN [4]. [6] proposed a fully\\ndata-driven Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model based\\napproach for Arctic Sea-ice forecasting and compared it with a\\ntraditional statistical model; they found that the LSTM showed\\ngood performance for 1-month sea ice concentration (SIC)\\nprediction, with less than 9 × 106 km2 of average monthly\\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE) and around 11×106 km2 of\\nmean absolute error during the melting season. [15] developed\\na 2D-CNN model that takes as input 8 atmospheric predictors\\nto predict SIC with 1 month’s lead time. They compared the\\nperformance with Random Forest baseline model, achieving\\nRMSE of 5.76 × 106 km2. [16] worked on daily prediction\\nof the Arctic Sea Ice Concentration using reanalysis data\\nbased on a Convolutional LSTM Network. They proposed\\na ConvLSTM model to predict SIC for T timestep given\\nT −1 and T −2 25 km resolution observational data from\\nNational Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (2008-2018).\\nThey compared their model with a 2DCNN model that takes\\nin a spatial map with pixel grids from T −1 timestep. Their\\nmodel achieved an RMSE of 11.2 × 106 km2 as compared to\\nthe 2DCNN with RMSE of 13.7 × 106 km2.\\nEnsembling is another hybrid modeling approach where\\noutputs from multiple models are combined to improve per-\\nformance, whereas it also reduces variance and generalization\\nerrors. [14] worked on an MLR + DNN ensemble model using\\nBayesian Model Averaging to predict sea-ice concentrations\\nfor the next 10-20 years. They evaluated their model using\\ncorrelation co-efficient (R2 score) and achieved normalized\\nRMSE of 0.8. [1] proposed an attention-based LSTM ensem-\\nble that takes in multi-temporal, daily and monthly, data and\\npredicts sea ice extent (SIE) for T + 1 timestep, achieving\\nan RMSE of 4.9 × 106 km2. To explore the potential of\\nprobabilistic modeling approaches for forecasting sea ice and\\nto aid uncertainty quantification, [2] performed a thorough\\ncomparative analysis of four probabilistic and two baseline\\nmachine learning and deep learning models and published\\nbenchmarking results for sea ice forecasting for multiple lead\\ntimes on these models. They evaluated these models perfor-\\nmance using RMSE error and R2 scores and reported Gaussian\\nProcess Regression (GPR) to achieve the most competent re-\\nsults. Our work takes inspiration from IceNet proposed by [3].\\nIceNet is a U-Net [19] based probabilistic model for seasonal\\nsea-ice forecasting. Their model takes in images as input and\\nforecasts as output Sea Ice Probabilities (SIP) for three classes\\n(open-water region SIC < 15%, ice-edge region 15% < SIC\\n< 80%, and confident ice region SIC > 80%) for next 6\\nmonths. Through probabilistic deep learning, they showed\\ntheir forecasted values to be competent with the physics-\\nbased ECMWF seasonal forecast system SEAS5 [12]. IceNet\\nis pretrained using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project\\n(CMIP6) 2,220 years (1800-2011) simulation data and is fine-\\ntuned on NSIDC’s observational data from 1979 to 2011. They\\nevaluated their model performance on observational data from\\n2012-2017 using integrated ice edge error (IIEE) and binary\\naccuracy (BACC). Following IceNet, [18] proposed SICNet,\\nbased on a Temporal Spatial Attention Module (TSAM) that\\ncaptures SIC variations for a lead time of 7 to 28 days. They\\nevaluated their work using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean\\nAbsolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and BACC. However,\\nthere are two major differences in our proposed MT-IceNet,\\nIceNet and SICNet. One, MT-IceNet produces spatial patterns\\nthrough per-pixel prediction for SIC values contrary to SIP\\nclassification of IceNet. Second, MT-IceNet shows promising\\nresults in the prediction of SIC on greater lead times i.e. 1\\nTABLE I\\nVARIABLES INCLUDED IN THE DATASET\\nVariable\\nSource\\nUnits\\nRange\\nDimensions\\nFrequency\\nSea Ice Concentration\\nNSIDC\\n% per pixel\\n0-100\\n448 x 304\\ndaily\\nLongwave Radiation\\nERA5\\nW/m2\\n0-300\\n66 x 360\\nhourly\\nRain Rate\\nERA5\\nmm/day\\n0-800\\n66 x 360\\ndaily\\nSnow Rate\\nERA5\\nmm/day\\n0-200\\n66 x 360\\ndaily\\nSea Surface Temperature\\nERA5\\nK\\n200-350\\n66 x 360\\ndaily\\nto 6 months whereas SICNet predicts SIC on a weekly i.e.\\nsubseasonal scale.\\nIII. DATASET\\nFor this study, we use observational sea-ice and reanalysis\\natmospheric and meteorological data which is available from\\n1979 till the present. The reanalysis data is available with open\\naccess and can be obtained from European Centre for Medium-\\nRange Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-5 global reanalysis\\nproduct [8]. Whereas the sea-ice concentration (SIC) values\\nare obtained from Nimbus-7 SSMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS\\npassive microwave data version 1 [5] provided by the National\\nSnow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). These variables along\\nwith their spatiotemporal resolution details are enlisted in\\nTable I.\\nFor the Arctic region, the SIC observational dataset contains\\nan uncertainty of about +-15% during the summer season due\\nto a high number of melt ponds that can skew the data [5].\\nDuring the winter months, this uncertainty decreases to about\\n+-5% as the sea ice tends to reach its peak in concentration\\nlevels. However, for modeling purposes, this concentration\\ndata can be considered as the ground truth.\\nThe inclusion of these variables is based on their causal\\nlinks with sea ice variations [11] and also based on their\\nphysical impact on weather trends in the Arctic. For instance,\\nsea surface temperature provides information on oceanic heat.\\nSimilarly, earlier rainfalls during spring trigger earlier Arctic\\nice and snow melt [7], [17]. Further, as highlighted by [9],\\n[10], regional differences in atmospheric pressure cause an\\nincrease in Arctic humidity, which in turn enables higher levels\\nof longwave radiation to reach the sea surface. Consequently,\\nthis can lead to earlier melting of sea ice. In short, each of\\nthe chosen predictors impacts Arctic sea ice through complex\\noceanic and atmospheric physical interactions.\\nA. Data Preprocessing\\nEach of the chosen data variables come in a different spatial\\nand temporal resolution. For instance, NSIDC provides daily\\nsea-ice concentrations in 25km resolution that is 448×304,\\nwhereas the reanalysis data is available in 1◦resolution, i.e.\\n360×180, as hourly and daily records. For our proposed\\nmodel, we required 5 dimensional inputs of shape (samples,\\ntimesteps, height, width, features). To achieve this, the first\\nstep after downloading raw data was to regrid individual 1◦\\nERA5 variables corresponding to the Arctic geolocation of\\n90N, 60N, 180E, 180W into the NSIDC polar projections,\\nthat is the 25km spatial (448 × 304) resolution of the sea ice\\nconcentration (SIC). To begin with, an empty array with the\\nlatitude and longitude geolocation index was created. Next, the\\nvalues from previous dimensions are interpolated to the new\\ndimensions and stored in the empty grid with new lat × lon\\ndimensions using the XESMF Python API. The variables\\nacquired in hourly data were aggregated to the daily timescale.\\nAfter the spatial and temporal rescaling was performed on\\nindividual variables, they were combined into a single h5 file\\nwith D x H x W x F dimensions. Here D is the total number of\\ndays, H is the height of images corresponding to 448 latitude,\\nW represents the width, which corresponds to 304 longitude\\nand F is the number of features which is 5.\\n1) Monthly Data: To generate the monthly dataset for our\\nmodel, we averaged the daily 30, 31 or 28 values correspond-\\ning to the different months. Special care was taken for leap\\nyears, e.g. in case of a leap year, we averaged 29 entries\\nfor February. This gave us 504 monthly records. Then we\\nsequentially divided the data into training and testing sets of\\n408 and 96 months. To reshape the data, a stateless rolling\\nwindow was applied to the training and testing data, creating\\n384 samples of 12 months each. Sample one contained months\\n1-12, sample two contained months 2-13, and the last sample\\ncontained months 372-384. Finally we got our training data in\\nthe shape M × T × H × W × F, where M = 384 samples,\\nT = 12 months, H × W = 448×304 pixel images and\\nF = 5 features. Similarly, the final shape of the test set was\\n84 × 12 × 448 × 304 × 5.\\n2) Bi-Monthly Data: Deep learning models require a large\\nvolume of diverse training data to generalize well on the\\nunseen test data. However, our monthly dataset is comprised\\nof only 504 records. To counter this small data problem, we\\ngenerated the second temporal resolution of semi-monthly or\\nbi-monthly data that not only increases the dataset size but\\nalso helps our model focus on sub-seasonal patterns. From our\\nprevious work [1], we observed high frequency data captures\\nsub-seasonal fluctuations better and in turn helps the model\\nlearn the seasonal patterns. For this, similar to aggregating 30\\nor 31 daily values, we aggregated samples of 15, 16 or 14\\ndaily records depending on the annual months of the year.\\nFor example, for January the two bi-monthly records were\\ncalculated by taking the average of 15 days and 16 days\\nrespectively. Similar to the rolling window applied to monthly\\ndata, we applied a 24 timestep rolling window to bi-monthly\\ndata to correspond to the same annual cycle as its monthly\\ncounterpart. The final dimensions for bi-monthly training and\\ntest sets were 384×24×448×304×5 and 84×24×448×304×5\\nFig. 1. End-to-end pipeline of our predictive model.\\nrespectively.\\nIV. METHOD: MT-ICENET\\nOur proposed MT-IceNet model is a UNet-based spatial and\\nmulti-temporal (MT) deep learning model for forecasting per-\\npixel Arctic sea ice concentrations (SIC). The model uses an\\nencoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and multi-\\ntemporal data to regenerate spatial maps at future timesteps.\\nAs shown in Figure II, we started off by downloading the raw\\ndata from multiple sources mentioned in Section III. Next,\\nwe preprocessed the data to bring it into uniform spatial\\nand temporal resolutions. We then reshaped the data into 5\\ndimension and sequentially split it into training and testing\\nsets. Sequential splitting is performed to retain the seasonality\\npatterns in the data. We then built our baseline and proposed\\nmodel MT-IceNet and finally evaluated the performance of all\\nmodels using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean\\nAbsolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2) score. The details\\nof our baseline models and constituent blocks of our proposed\\nmodel are as follows.\\nA. Baseline Models\\nTo design our baseline models, we utilized two widely used\\nspatiotemporal deep learning techniques that are, the Convolu-\\ntional Neural Network (CNN) and Convolutional Long Short\\nTerm Memory (ConvLSTM) models. One reason for choosing\\nthese two models is that they have been used in previous\\nsolutions proposed for this problem. Another reason is that\\nthey also work as the constituent blocks of our proposed model\\nMT-IceNet.\\n1) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): We designed a\\nsimple CNN model with three 2D convolutional layers using\\nthe Keras API. Each of these layers was followed by a 2D\\nMax Pooling layer for dimensionality reduction. We flattened\\nthe output from the third CNN layer and appended two fully\\nconnected (Dense) layers for regression. Finally, we reshaped\\nthe output from the final Dense layer into 448 × 304 to retrieve\\nthe predicted spatial maps. The input to this model were mini-\\nbatches of 3D tensors of shape H × W × F corresponding\\nto 448 × 304 × 5 dimensional images whereas the output\\nwas monthly SIC percentage values in the shape of 448 ×\\n304 images for multiple lead times. To incorporate the lead\\ntime in monthly forward predictions, a lag (offset) of 1 to 6\\nmonths was created in input features and target SIC values by\\nremoving the first 1 to 6 rows from the SIC column and last 1\\nto 6 rows from the 5 input features. So that a January 1979 data\\nsample would correspond to February 1979 SIC values for a\\nlag of 1 month, a January 1979 data sample would correspond\\nto March 1979 SIC values for a lag of 2 months, and so on.\\nThe model was trained six times, each time for a different lag\\nvalue.\\n2) Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM):\\nWe further designed a ConvLSTM model by appending one\\nConvLSTM layer at the beginning of our baseline CNN\\nmodel. Since ConvLSTM model requires 4D input tensors,\\nwe used the same input train and test datasets generated for\\nour proposed MT-IceNet model for training this ConvLSTM\\nbaseline model, that is, T ×H ×W ×F. This model was also\\ndeveloped using the Keras API. We trained four ConvLSTM\\nmodels using the monthly dataset for lead times of 1 to 6\\nmonths. To incorporate the lag, an offset was added to train\\nand test sets in a similar manner as done for our CNN baseline\\nmodel.\\nB. MT-IceNet Model\\nOur proposed Multitemporal (MT)-IceNet is a U-Net based\\nmodel that comprises two paths of neural network layers,\\nthe contractive path that we represent as encoder, and the\\nexpansive path represented as the decoder. The architecture\\ndiagram is shown in Figure 2.\\n1) U-Net: A U-Net based model was first introduced for\\nimage segmentation for bio-medical imagery [19]. It comprises\\nthree constituent blocks; the encoder, the decoder and the\\nbottleneck block that acts as a bridge between both the encoder\\nand decoder. What distinguishes a U-Net architecture from\\na transformer based model is the use of skip connections\\nbetween different layers of encoder and decoder. These skip\\nconnections provide upsampling layers important features\\nFig. 2. Model Architecture of the Multi-temporal (MT) IceNet Model.\\nfrom the downsampling layers that are lost due to the depth\\nof the network.\\n2) Encoder: Our encoder comprises two downsampling\\nblocks. The first block consists of a ConvLSTM layer that\\ntakes in monthly data as input in the shape T × H × W × F,\\nhere T = 12. The output of ConvLSTM layers is passed to\\ntwo 2D convolution layers, followed by a batch normalization\\nlayer and a 2D max pooling layer. The second block follows\\nthe same architecture with the difference of input shape. Here,\\nthe ConvLSTM layer if given bi-monthly data of the shape\\n24 × H × W × F. In every successive layer of the encoder,\\nwe increment the output channels by a multiplicative factor of\\n2, as shown in Figure 2. All CNN layers use the same 3 × 3\\nkernel size filters whereas the ConvLSTM layer uses a 5 × 5\\nkernel. The activation function ReLU is used in all the encoder\\nlayers. The encoder part of our model helps learn low-level\\nspatiotemporal dependencies in the data and identifies patterns\\nneeded for predicting SIC spatial maps.\\n3) Decoder: The purpose of the decoder block is to up-\\nsample the low-level features learnt from the data and help\\nreconstruct the spatial map in the same dimension as the input\\nbut at a future timestep. Similar to the encoder, the decoder\\ncomprises two upsampling blocks. Every block comprises a\\n2×2 upsampling layer using the nearest interpolation method\\nand a 2 × 2 kernel size filter. The skip connection is built\\nby concatenating the output of each upsampling layer with\\nthe output from a corresponding downsampled feature map\\ngenerated by the encoder, as shown in the Figure 2. Once\\nthe outputs are concatenated, they are passed through two\\n2D convolutional layers. The output channel size of every\\nCNN layer is reduced by a factor of 2 in order to regain the\\ninitial input dimension. Finally, a 1×1 convolution with linear\\nactivation is applied to the decoder’s output to generate the\\npredicted spatial map.\\nC. Postprocessing\\nWe performed two post-processing steps on the predictions\\ngenerated by our model. Since our predictions correspond\\nto sea ice concentration values that are basically percentage\\nvalues between 0 to 100, we rescale the values predicted by\\nthe model to [0,100] by clipping all predictions less than 0 to 0\\nand all predictions greater than 100 to 100. This helps interpret\\nthe regression results. Further, to help visualize the predictions,\\nwe multiplied the predicted spatial maps with a binary land\\nmask. Since we are not interested in land-area predictions,\\nthis multiplicative step discards the land area predictions by\\nassigning them zero-weightage while all ocean and water body\\npredictions are retained. This also helps in evaluating the\\nmodel using the evaluation metrics discussed in Section V.\\nV. EVALUATION\\nWe first present the experimental setup for our research\\nwork in Section V.A. We then move forward to compare our\\nperformance with the baseline CNN and ConvLSTM models.\\nWe also compared our work with two recently proposed\\nsolutions to SIC forecasting using 1) multitask-ConvLSTM\\nmethod [13] and 2) IceNet [3]. We present the results of this\\ncomparative analysis in Section V.B. Finally we perform the\\nqualitative analysis of our MT-IceNet predictions in Section\\nV.C.\\nA. Experimental Setup\\nAll our experiments are performed using the Amazon Web\\nServices (AWS) cloud-based Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\\naccelerated computing instances with high frequency 2.5 GHz\\n(base) Intel Xeon Scalable Processor, 32 vCPUs and 64 GBs\\nof GPU memory. The total storage space required for our\\nexperiments is around 600 GBs which includes our train\\nand test datasets, model computations and storage and visual\\nillustrations of our results. Our MT-IceNet model is trained\\nusing Keras Functional API with a Tensorflow backend and\\nhas around 148,000 trainable parameters. This is 99% less\\nthan the 44 million trainable weights of the IceNet [3] model.\\nThrough a less complex architecture, we also show how simple\\napproaches can generate better results.\\nWe trained our model using Adam optimizer, Root Mean\\nSquared Error (RMSE) loss and trained it on 100 epochs using\\nthe Early stopping criteria with a learning rate of 0.0001. Due\\nto the high dimensionality of input data and a limited RAM,\\nwe could only process mini-batches of 4 samples each.\\nEvaluation Metrics: We report the RMSE, MAE and R2\\nperformance evaluation scores for our model in Tables II, III\\nIV. Since it is a spatiotemporal 3D dataset corresponding to\\nlatitude and longitude values, we customized the RMSE and\\nMAE metrics for our models evaluation using the following\\nformula:\\nRMSESIC =\\nv\\nu\\nu\\ntΣIΣJ\\n\\nY [i, j] −ˆY [i, j]\\n2\\nN\\n(1)\\nMAESIC =\\nΣIΣJ\\nY [i, j] −ˆY [i, j]\\n\\nN\\n(2)\\nHere, Y represents ground truth while ˆY represents predicted\\nSIC values. i corresponds to 448 latitude, j corresponds 304\\nlongitude values and N represents the total number of test\\nsamples. While both, RMSE and MAE, are metrics to calculate\\nerror, RMSE gives relatively higher weightage to large error\\nand can help in capturing the variance in error magnitudes.\\nR2 = 1 −RSS\\nTSS\\n(3)\\nWe further evaluated our model using the R2 score. As shown\\nin Eq. 3, RSS represents the sum of squares of residuals and\\nTSS represents the total sum of squares. Higher R2 score\\nrepresents better performance.\\nB. Comparative Analysis\\nFor the comparative analysis, we first trained the baseline\\nmodels CNN and ConvLSTM to predict SIC values for a\\nlead time of 1 to 6 months. We then trained the Multitask-\\nConvLSTM and IceNet on our dataset to predict SIC values\\nfor the same lead times. We are grateful to the authors\\nfor providing open-access to their codes on github. Since,\\nIceNet is a computationally expensive classification model that\\ntakes in 50 input features and requires 1TB of memory, we\\ncustomized their models to a light-weight version comprising\\nof only 2 downscaling and 2 upscaling blocks. We further\\ntweaked their output layer by removing the classification layer\\nand replacing it with a regression layer to generate 448 × 304\\nspatial maps at multiple lead times. We refer to this modified\\nversion as IceNet†. The multitask-ConvLSTM was proposed\\nto jointly predict per-pixel SIC values and the total sea-ice\\nextent corresponding to the entire spatial region. All these\\nmodels were trained and evaluated using the same train and\\ntest split to have a fair comparison of their performance. In\\nour comparison with other models, we only took into account\\nthe SIC prediction and ignored the sea-ice extent values. We\\nfirst analyzed the performance of baseline models for SIC\\nprediction and compared it with our MT-IceNet predictions.\\n1) Quantitative Analysis: In Tables II and IV, it is evident\\nby increasing values of RMSE and MAE scores that both\\nCNN and ConvLSTM have poor predictive performance as\\ncompared to MT-IceNet, where our model reportedly de-\\ncreased the RMSE error by 51% as compared to CNN, by\\n40% as compared to ConvLSTM and by 58% as compared\\nto IceNet†, for all lead times. The same trend was observed\\nin MAE error where MT-IceNet reduced the MAE error by\\nmore than 60% as compared to its Multi-task ConvLSTM and\\nIceNet counterparts. We further noticed that MT-IceNet has a\\nsignificantly better R2 score with a notable lead of around 10%\\nfor all lead times as compared to the CNN and ConvLSTM\\nmodels. The best results have been highlighted in bold in all\\nour result tables.\\nAs seen in Table II, both multitask-ConvLSTM and IceNet†\\ntake a sharp increase in RMSE score after a lead time time of\\none month, whereas MT-IceNet still shows a trivial increase\\nin the RMSE scores with only a 2 point increase in RMSE\\nand 1 point increase in MAE from lead time of 1 month to\\nthe sixth month. To our surprise, the highest reported errors\\nare from IceNet† model where the RMSE and MAE errors\\nhave significantly higher and R2 scores have very low values\\nfor the IceNet† predictions. It is evident from all three metric\\nresults that MT-IceNet outperforms all baseline and recently\\nproposed models for SIC forecasting by showing a promising\\nand persistent predictive performance on greater lead times.\\nThe second best performance is achieved by the baseline\\nConvLSTM model. An interesting observation here is that all\\nFig. 3. NSIDC Observed Sea Ice Concentration (%) vs MT-IceNet Predictions for Summer 2020.\\nFig. 4.

Though this is an interesting finding, the actual cause\\nof this performance improvement is yet to be known.\\n2) Qualitative Analysis: To evaluate the quality of our per-\\npixel predictions, we plot the spatial maps generated by the\\nMT-IceNet model over the Arctic region using Python’s car-\\ntopy API for geospatial projections. Figures 3 and 5 show the\\nforecasted spatial plots where every pixel value lies between\\n[0,100]. Here 100 represents 100% ice concentration whereas\\n0 represents the absence of ice in that specific pixel. Since\\neach pixel corresponds to a 25 × 25 km2 land area, any\\nvalue ranging in between 0 to 100 represents the percentage\\narea covered with ice in that region. Looking at Figure 3,\\nit is observed that MT-IceNet overpredicts September sea\\nice at greater lead times which is the trickiest to predict.\\nNonetheless, our model shows great performance throughout\\nMarch predictions which is the peak Winter time in the Arctic,\\nas shown in Figure 5.\\nTo have a clear identification of regions with incorrect pre-\\ndictions, we plot the differences in the actual SIC observations\\nand the predicted values for multiple lead times, both for\\nSummer and Winter peak months, i.e., September and March,\\nas shown in Figures 4 and 6. Upon inspecting Figure 4, we\\nsee that model performs poorly only near the coastal areas of\\nGreenland. For March, we notice that the model underpredicts\\nthe sea ice over the coastal areas. This can be considered a\\nminor performance flaw as edge predictions are usually the\\ntrickiest for spatiotemporal models. For September predictions,\\nas shown in Figure 4, we notice how model overpredicts\\nSummer sea ice at greater lead times. This is due to the concept\\nof seasonal barrier, according to which the seasonality patterns\\nare hard to identify from a distance of more than 3 months.\\nUsing the SIC values, we calculated the overall sea ice extent\\nfor the entire region by calculating the area-weighted sum of\\nthe Arctic region using the per-pixel area map provided by\\nNSIDC. We plotted these sea ice extent values as a time-\\nseries plot for multiple lead times, as shown in Figure 7.\\nWe noticed how our model overpredicts summer sea ice and\\nunderpredicts winter sea ice at greater lead times. We also\\nnoticed the performance improvement in lead times 5 (red) and\\n6 (lime) where the model predictions once again come closer\\nto the actual observations (blue). Overall, we did not find any\\nsharp increase or decrease in the SIC model predictions as the\\nlead time increases. This means our model can overcome the\\nperformance versus lead-time tradeoff that is faced by most of\\nthe models proposed for seasonal predictions.\\nVI. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK\\nIn this paper, we presented our work on a spatiotemporal\\ndeep learning model that jointly learns from multi-temporal\\ninputs to forecast Arctic sea ice at lead times of 1 to 6 months.\\nThrough experiment and ablation study, we showed how our\\nmodel outperforms the baseline and recent state-of-the-art\\napproaches using a U-Net based architecture by overcoming\\nthe small data problem and seasonality barrier challenge. Our\\nMT-IceNet not only outperforms the baseline and other recent\\nwork but also shows a consistency in forecasting SIC values\\nat greater lead times. We believe our proposed model can\\nsubstantially improve our ability in predicting the future Arctic\\nsea ice changes at sub-seasonal to seasonal scales, which is\\nfundamental for forecasting transportation routes, length of\\nopen water, resource development, coastal erosion, and threats\\nto Arctic coastal communities and wildlife.\\nIn the future, we plan to extend our work to multi-scale\\nspatiotemporal modeling in order to jointly process fine and\\ncoarse resolutions of geolocation information that can be vital\\nin solving similar Earth Science problems. We further plan to\\nincorporate the attention mechanism in our model to identify\\nimportant contributing factors to the prediction. Lastly, we plan\\nto work on data-driven causal discovery to study variations in\\nArctic sea ice using spatiotemporal deep learning models.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nThis work is supported by NSF grants: CAREER: Big Data\\nClimate Causality (OAC-1942714) and HDR Institute: HARP\\n- Harnessing Data and Model Revolution in the Polar Regions\\n(OAC-2118285).
