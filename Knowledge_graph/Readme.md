# PDF to Knowledge Graph Generator
A local, private, and intelligent system to extract **keywords** and **semantic relationships** from uploaded research PDFs and generate an interactive **Knowledge Graph**.  
Built with Streamlit, Neo4j, Ollama (LLaMA 3), and PyVis.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project allows users to upload one or more research papers (PDFs), automatically extract the key concepts, and generate an interactive Knowledge Graph.  
It uses advanced keyword extraction (TF-IDF, YAKE, KeyBERT) and LLM-based relation extraction (using Ollama models) to build meaningful graphs for scientific documents.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Upload single or multiple PDFs.
- Intelligent keyword extraction (from *Keywords section* if present, else model-based).
- Relation extraction between keywords using LLM (LLaMA3).
- Visualize the generated Knowledge Graph interactively.
- Download the extracted relations as CSV or JSON.
- 100% Local Processing (Privacy-Preserving).
